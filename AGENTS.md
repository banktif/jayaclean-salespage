# AGENTS.md — Universal Operating Standards

This is an AGENTS.md file — the open, cross-tool standard read natively by
Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, OpenCode, and most other AI
coding agents. Committing this to a repo's root means every agent that
touches the repo picks up these rules automatically — no per-tool setup.

---

## 1. Git checkpoint discipline (mandatory, every session)

Before touching any file, you MUST:

1. Check current git status is clean (`git status`). If not clean, stop and
   report — do not proceed on top of uncommitted changes.
2. Create a checkpoint tag before starting work:
   `git tag checkpoint-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)`
3. State the tag name you created in your first response of the session.

At the end of the session (or after any risky multi-file change), commit with
a clear message describing what changed and why — not "update files" or
"fix bug".

If a task will touch more than 3 files or modify core logic (database schema,
auth, payment, task queue), create a new branch instead of committing to
main:
`git checkout -b task/<short-description>`

---

## 2. No claiming success without verification

You are NOT allowed to report a task as "done", "fixed", "working", or
"complete" unless you have actually run one of the following and show the
output:

- The test suite (`pytest`, etc.) — paste the actual pass/fail output
- The specific script/endpoint you changed, with real output/response shown
- A lint/type check, if that's what the task was about

If you cannot run verification (e.g. no test exists, external dependency
unavailable), you MUST say so explicitly: "I could not verify this because
X — here's what I changed and what still needs manual testing."

Never say "should work now" or "this fixes it" without pasted proof. If asked
"did it work?" and you have not run anything, the correct answer is "I
haven't verified yet — running now" — not a confident yes.

---

## 3. Rollback safety net

Before any change that touches more than one file:

1. Confirm the last checkpoint tag exists (`git tag --list "checkpoint-*"`)
2. If something breaks mid-task, do not keep patching on top — offer to
   roll back first: `git reset --hard checkpoint-<name>`, then retry with a
   different approach.

Never force-push over shared history without stating clearly: "This will
discard commits after `<tag>`. Confirm before I proceed."

---

## 4. Scope discipline

- Only touch files directly relevant to the task described. If you think a
  broader refactor is needed, propose it separately — do not do it inline
  without asking.
- Do not delete or rewrite existing working code "for cleanliness" unless
  explicitly asked.
- If the task is ambiguous, ask ONE clarifying question before writing code —
  do not guess silently on things like schema fields, API contracts, or
  business logic (e.g. tax calculation, invoice numbering).

---

## 5. Reporting format (every response)

End every substantive task with:

```
CHANGED: <files touched>
VERIFIED: <what you ran, and the result — or "not verified: <reason>">
CHECKPOINT: <tag or commit used before this task>
NEXT: <what still needs manual review from the user, if anything>
```

This format is non-negotiable — it exists so the user (non-technical,
reviewing your output) can trust what actually happened without needing to
read the code.

This file is the UNIVERSAL standard — one copy, committed at the repo root,
applies automatically to whichever agent tool touches this repo. Add a
short project-specific note below this line if the repo needs it (stack,
things that break silently) — keep sections above unchanged.

For Claude Code compatibility: also create a `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root
containing only `@AGENTS.md` on its first line — this makes Claude Code
import this same file instead of needing a separate copy.

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC: JAYABINA

# JAYABINA — AGENTS.md
# Project rules & memory anchor. READ THIS FIRST every new session.
# Last updated: 2026-07-20
# ⚠️ Site refactored to CLEAN URLS — real apps live in folders: admin/index.html,
#    worker/index.html (staff), customer/index.html. Root *.html are redirect stubs.
#    Hosted on Cloudflare Pages (migrated from GitHub Pages). See section 13 for
#    current architecture. See section 14 for Hugo blog system.

## CURRENT CLOUDFLARE MIGRATION OVERRIDE (2026-07-16)

This section supersedes older Supabase architecture and deploy notes below.

- ⛔ **WWW SITE LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-20):** `www.jayabina.com` (Pages project `jayabina`, `site/` Hugo source) must NEVER be deleted, modified, or redeployed without an explicit owner instruction in the current session. GrapesJS editor `protectReason()` guards `site/content/` — do NOT disable it.
- ⛔ **ADMIN SYSTEM LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-18):** `admin.jayabina.com` (Pages project `jayabina-admin`, `admin/index.html`, `admin/editor.html`, `admin/vendor/`) must NEVER be deleted, modified, or redeployed without an explicit owner instruction in the current session.
- ⛔ **CUCI TANGKI PAGE FULL LOCK (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The ENTIRE cuci tangki page (`site/layouts/partials/service-tank.html`) is FULLY LOCKED. This is the PRIMARY booking funnel and main revenue page. NO AI agent, debug session, or automated tool may modify ANY part of this file — HTML structure, inline CSS, inline JS, booking form logic, section layouts, copy text, button colors, spacing, image references, ANYTHING — without explicit owner instruction in the current session. This lock supersedes ALL other task instructions. Violating this lock = site revenue at risk.

  **COVERED SECTIONS (locked individually + collectively):**
  - Hero section (badge, headline, subheadline, buttons, image, trust indicators)
  - Emotion section (image, copy, spacing)
  - Signs section (cards, layout, content)
  - Proof section (before/after, deliverables)
  - Process section (4-step cards)
  - Benefits section (4 benefit cards)
  - Price section (RM300, scope list, payment boxes)
  - Booking form (calendar, slots, fields — email REQUIRED, validation JS)
  - FAQ section (accordion, questions, answers)
  - Final CTA section (headline, subheadline, buttons)

  **🔁 ROLLBACK to last known-good state:**
  ```bash
  git show 7c6fa1d:site/layouts/partials/service-tank.html > site/layouts/partials/service-tank.html
  git add site/layouts/partials/service-tank.html
  git commit -m "rollback: restore cuci tangki page to locked state"
  git push origin master
  ```
  Tag `7c6fa1d` is protected — never delete this tag.

  **🔁 ONE-CLICK ROLLBACK:**
  ```bash
  # Restore booking form HTML/CSS/JS to template:
  cp site/layouts/partials/service-tank.html.template site/layouts/partials/service-tank.html

  # Restore API capacity code:
  git checkout booking-form-template -- cf-api/src/routes/bookings.ts cf-api/src/routes/slots.ts cf-api/src/db/schema.ts

  # Apply D1 migration if needed:
  npx wrangler d1 execute jayabina-db --file=cf-api/migrations/0003_drop_slot_unique_index.sql --remote

  # Deploy:
  npx wrangler deploy
  git add -A && git commit -m "rollback: restore booking form template" && git push origin master
  ```
- ⛔ **HERO SECTION DESIGN LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The hero sections of ALL pages (homepage `site/layouts/index.html` + 3 service pages `site/layouts/partials/service-tank.html`, `service-roof.html`, `service-paint.html`) must NEVER be modified, restructured, or reformatted by any AI agent or debug session. This lock protects HTML structure, CSS grid layout, spacing values, and mobile/desktop behavior. Violating ANY rule below will BREAK the hero section layout.

  **🔒 HARD RULES — any violation = hero layout break:**

  **A. HTML STRUCTURE (service pages):**
  1. `.hero-actions` MUST be placed INSIDE `.hero-copy` — directly after `.lead` paragraph, NOT in a separate grid row.
  2. `.hero-visual` MUST be a direct child of `.hero-grid` in grid column 2, spanning all rows.
  3. Structure must match: `hero-copy > [hero-badge, h1, .lead, .hero-actions]` then `hero-visual`.

  **B. CSS GRID LAYOUT (service pages, desktop):**
  1. `.hero-grid` MUST use: `display:grid; grid-template-columns:1fr 1.5fr; column-gap:56px; row-gap:20px; align-items:center` (tank) or `1fr 1fr` (roof/paint).
  2. `.hero-grid .hero-copy{grid-column:1; grid-row:1}`
  3. `.hero-grid>.hero-visual{grid-column:2; grid-row:1/3}` (or `1/4` depending on content)
  4. NEVER add `.hero-grid>.hero-actions` grid rule — hero-actions is inside hero-copy.
  5. NEVER change `column-gap:56px` or `row-gap:20px`.

  **C. SPACING (service pages, desktop):**
  1. `.hero-copy>.lead{margin-bottom:30px}` — this creates the gap between subheadline and buttons. DO NOT change.
  2. NO `margin-top` on `.hero-actions`.
  3. `.hero-actions{display:flex; gap:12px; flex-wrap:wrap}` — DO NOT change.

  **D. MOBILE LAYOUT (all pages, ≤1023px):**
  1. Mobile order MUST be: **center headline → center subheadline → image → buttons, NO text below buttons**.
  2. `.hero-grid` must collapse to single column: `grid-template-columns:1fr; row-gap:20px`.
  3. All `.hero-grid>` children must have `grid-column:auto; grid-row:auto`.
  4. `.hero-copy` must have `text-align:center` on mobile.
  5. `.hero-copy h1, .hero-copy .lead` must have `text-align:center` on mobile.
  6. NEVER add `.hero-note` or any text element below `.hero-actions`.

  **E. HOMEPAGE HERO (site/layouts/index.html):**
  1. Same rules as service pages for mobile layout.
  2. Desktop grid: `grid-template-columns:minmax(0,1.12fr) minmax(390px,.88fr); gap:64px`.
  3. `.hero-actions` inside `.hero-copy` with natural flow — DO NOT place in separate grid row.
  4. `.hero-panel` (service preview cards) in column 2.

  **🛡️ ROLLBACK to known-good hero state:**
  ```bash
  git show 1e611a7:site/layouts/partials/service-tank.html > site/layouts/partials/service-tank.html
  git show 1e611a7:site/layouts/partials/service-roof.html > site/layouts/partials/service-roof.html
  git show 1e611a7:site/layouts/partials/service-paint.html > site/layouts/partials/service-paint.html
  git show d044ae6:site/layouts/index.html > site/layouts/index.html
  ```
  These tags are protected — never delete them.
- ⛔ **FINAL CTA SECTION LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The final CTA section (`<section class="final-cta">`) at the bottom of all 3 service pages and homepage must NEVER be modified, redesigned, restructured, or have its content changed by any AI agent or debug session without explicit owner instruction. This section contains the closing call-to-action with WhatsApp and action buttons. Lock includes: HTML structure, copy text, CSS styling, button layout, and responsive behavior.
- ⛔ **FULLWIDTH LAYOUT LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-20):** Both portals must remain fullwidth on desktop — `.d-main` has NO `max-width` constraint. Content stretches to fill available space.
- ⛔ **WORKER SCHEDULE/CALENDAR LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The calendar/schedule view in `worker/index.html` (`staff.jayabina.com`) must NEVER be removed, restructured, or have its behavior changed. Features: weekly view (Mon-Sun), status-colored task cards, prev/next week navigation, Today button, desktop 7-column grid / mobile stacked list. Data source: same `loadJobs()` — syncs with admin assign + customer booking. Clicking task → `openJob()` modal. Any change requires explicit owner instruction.
- ⛔ **PERSISTENT LOGIN LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-20):** Login session must survive page refresh indefinitely. Worker: token in localStorage + `jc_user_cache` fallback. Customer: `jc_login_phone` in localStorage with `autoLogin()`. Only explicit logout clears the session. Do NOT change this behavior.
- ⛔ **ROOF PAGE SECTION 5-6 HEADLINE LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** `service-roof.html` sections #proses and #harga MUST have these exact CSS values — DO NOT change: headline h2 3 lines (font: clamp(1.55rem,1.35rem+.8vw,1.9rem), heading div min-width:56%, max-width:none) | subheadline p 2 lines (font: clamp(1.08rem,1rem+.3vw,1.3rem), line-height:1.55, flex:0 0 34%, -webkit-line-clamp:2). Layout: side-by-side flex, heading left, paragraph right.
- ⛔ **HEADER, FOOTER & BURGER-MENU SYSTEM LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The following files form the UNIVERSAL template-driven header/footer system. They must NEVER be modified, deleted, reformatted, or have their structure changed by any AI agent, debug session, or automated tool — ONLY the admin template system (sync button) may write to the partial files listed below. Violating any rule in this section will BREAK the ENTIRE website header/footer across ALL pages.

  **LOCKED FILES (touch = site-wide breakage):**
  | File | Role | Rule |
  |------|------|------|
  | `site/layouts/partials/header.html` | Universal header HTML | NEVER edit manually. Template system sync target. |
  | `site/layouts/partials/footer.html` | Combined footer wrapper | NEVER edit. Generated by template sync. |
  | `site/layouts/partials/footer-desktop.html` | Desktop footer HTML | NEVER edit. Template system sync target. |
  | `site/layouts/partials/footer-mobile.html` | Mobile footer HTML | NEVER edit. Template system sync target. |
  | `site/layouts/partials/burger-menu.html` | Universal mobile menu | NEVER edit. Shared by ALL pages. |
  | `site/assets/css/main.css` | Central CSS — header, footer, buttons, typography | NEVER remove `.site-nav`, `.site-footer`, `.f-acc`, `.menu-toggle`, `.mobile-menu`, `.mm-*`, `.brand-mark`, `.nav-links`, `.nav-actions`, `.footer-*` rules. NEVER change CSS cascade order. |
  | `site/assets/js/main.js` | Mobile menu handler, smooth scroll, FAQ, sticky CTA | NEVER remove or modify menu/burger logic. Service pages depend on this. |
  | `site/layouts/index.html` | Homepage layout | Must contain `{{ partial \"header.html\" . }}` and `{{ partial \"footer.html\" . }}`. Must load `main.css` via Hugo pipeline. |
  | `site/layouts/partials/service-tank.html` | Tank service page | Must contain `{{ partial \"header.html\" . }}` and `{{ partial \"footer.html\" . }}`. Must load `main.css` before inline `<style>`. Must load `main.js`. |
  | `site/layouts/partials/service-roof.html` | Roof service page | Same as service-tank.html. |
  | `site/layouts/partials/service-paint.html` | Paint service page | Same as service-tank.html. |

  **HARD RULES (any violation = site breakage):**
  1. 🚫 NEVER add `.site-nav`, `.site-footer`, `.f-acc`, `.menu-toggle`, `.mobile-menu`, `.mm-*`, `.brand-mark{width`, `.brand-mark{height`, `.footer-*` CSS to service page inline `<style>` — these WILL override `main.css` and break consistency.
  2. 🚫 NEVER add duplicate `menuToggle`/`mobileMenu`/`closeMenu`/`openMenu` JS to service pages — `main.js` handles them exclusively.
  3. 🚫 NEVER change the CSS load order: `main.css` MUST load BEFORE inline `<style>` in ALL pages.
  4. 🚫 NEVER remove `{{ partial \"header.html\" . }}` or `{{ partial \"footer.html\" . }}` from any page template.
  5. 🔒 To edit header/footer design: use Admin → Website → Templates → edit & sync. This is the ONLY supported path.
  6. 🔒 Template HTML stored in D1 `website_templates` table. GitHub partials are write-only (sync output). The sync commits must preserve the lock comments.
- ⛔ **COLOR THEME SYSTEM LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The template color theme system (`admin → Website → Templates → Color Theme`) must NEVER be removed, restructured, or have its functionality altered. This includes:
  - D1 keys: `template_color_header`, `template_color_footer`
  - API route: `/api/website/templates/theme` (GET/PUT)
  - Partial: `site/layouts/partials/theme-colors.html` — loaded AFTER main.css on ALL pages
  - Admin UI: color pickers + hex inputs in Templates tab
  - Color format: `#RRGGBB:#RRGGBB:#RRGGBB` (bg-start:bg-end:text-color)
  - Theme CSS generates: `.site-nav`, `.site-footer`, `.f-acc`, `.f-links` overrides with `!important`
- ⛔ **BLOG SYSTEM LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The Hugo blog templates must NEVER have their structure, layout, or core sections removed. Locked files:
  - `site/layouts/blog/list.html` — listing page (hero, featured card, article grid, pagination, categories, subscribe CTA)
  - `site/layouts/_default/single.html` — single article (hero, meta, prose, sidebar, related articles)
  - `site/content/blog/_index.md` — section metadata
  - Blog content articles (`site/content/blog/*.md`) — articles are Hugo-generated content, only edit via Admin → Content tab
- ⛔ **TEMPLATE API & D1 SYSTEM LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The template infrastructure must NEVER be deleted or have its core routes removed:
  - D1 table: `website_templates` (type, slot, html_content, is_active)
  - API routes: `GET/PUT /api/website/templates`, `GET/PUT /api/website/templates/theme`, `POST /api/website/templates/:type/activate/:slot`, `POST /api/website/templates/sync`, `POST /api/website/templates/seed`
  - Worker: `cf-api/src/routes/website.ts` — template and theme route handlers
  - Worker: `cf-api/src/db/schema.ts` — `websiteTemplates` table definition
  - Admin UI: `admin/index.html` — Templates tab, template CRUD functions, color theme UI
- ⛔ **4-PAGE LAYOUT SYSTEM LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The custom layout templates for Tentang Kami, Servis, Blog, and Hubungi Kami must NEVER be replaced with generic/default templates or have their section structure removed. These files override Hugo's default list/single templates with multi-section modern layouts:
  - `site/layouts/tentang-kami/list.html` — 6 sections: siapa kami, tiga servis, membezakan kami, cara bekerja, FAQ, final CTA. Uses tk-* prefixed CSS classes, reveal animations, dark green company facts panel, 4 benefit cards with SVG icons.
  - `site/layouts/servis/list.html` — 7 sections: service cards, decision guide (sv-guide with symptom→match cards), why choose (sv-benefits), process steps, FAQ, final CTA. Uses sv-* prefixed CSS, gradient backgrounds.
  - `site/layouts/blog/list.html` — 8 sections: hero, featured article card, article grid (rotating gradient thumbnails), category pills, empty state (SVG illustration), subscribe CTA, related services, pagination. Uses self-contained CSS with --b-* variables.
  - `site/layouts/hubungi-kami/list.html` — 7 sections: contact methods (hk-card with WhatsApp primary), checklist (hk-checklist numbered), timeline (hk-timeline with vertical line), business info panel, FAQ, coverage tags. Uses hk-* prefixed CSS.
  - Content files renamed to `_index.md` for proper Hugo branch bundle resolution: `site/content/tentang-kami/_index.md`, `site/content/hubungi-kami/_index.md`.
  - DO NOT revert these to `_default/single.html` or `_default/list.html`.
- ⛔ **BURGER MENU SYSTEM LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The mobile burger menu design and behavior must NEVER be reverted or altered without explicit owner instruction:
  - **Icons:** `>` arrow in green (#146c43) replacing emoji. White on green portal buttons.
  - **Accordion behavior:** Auto-close — only ONE section open at a time (main.js line 24 + homepage inline JS). Clicking a new section closes the previously open one.
  - **Colors:** Menu background = mint (#f1fbf5, from theme-colors.html). Menu toggle (burger icon) = green (#146c43). Accordion toggle (::after +) = green on mint bg, white on green bg when open.
  - **Text alignment:** Left-aligned via `justify-content:flex-start` + `text-align:left` on `.mm-summary`, with `margin-left:auto` on `::after` to keep + icon right.
  - **Portal buttons:** Solid green (`btn-primary`) instead of outline. Width: 60% of menu. Open in new tab (`target="_blank"`).
  - Locked files: `site/layouts/partials/burger-menu.html`, `site/assets/js/main.js` (line 24 accordion logic), `site/layouts/index.html` (inline accordion JS), `site/layouts/partials/theme-colors.html` (burger menu color rules).
  - **🔁 ROLLBACK:**
    ```bash
    git show 2462e45:site/layouts/partials/burger-menu.html > site/layouts/partials/burger-menu.html
    git show 2462e45:site/assets/js/main.js > site/assets/js/main.js
    ```
- ⛔ **FOOTER THEME SYSTEM LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The footer color and background settings must NEVER be hardcoded in page-level CSS or bypass the admin theme system:
  - **Homepage:** Footer CSS REMOVED from inline `<style>` block. Footer now relies on `main.css` (structure) + `theme-colors.html` (admin-set colors), same as all other pages.
  - **Missing rule added:** `.footer-info span{color:...}` in both `theme-colors.html` and `cf-api/src/routes/website.ts` `generateThemeCSS()` function — ensures company name/registration text follows admin footer text color.
  - **Background gradient:** Footer uses same dark green hero gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg,#052e22,#0d3b2e 58%,#126044 100%)`. Applied via `theme-colors.html` with `!important`.
  - DO NOT re-add footer CSS to homepage inline `<style>` — this will override admin theme settings.
- ⛔ **HOMEPAGE HERO BADGE LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The homepage hero badge (`<div class="hero-badge">`) text and structure must NEVER be changed without explicit owner instruction:
  - Current: `<span class="pulse"></span>servis selenggara rumah` — lowercase, single pulse dot, no location suffix.
  - DO NOT capitalize or add "KL & Selangor" back.
- ⛔ **FINAL CTA REMOVAL LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** The final-cta section has been REMOVED from all 4 pages. DO NOT re-add it:
  - `site/layouts/index.html` — final-cta HTML + CSS removed
  - `site/layouts/partials/service-tank.html` — final-cta HTML + CSS removed
  - `site/layouts/partials/service-roof.html` — final-cta HTML + CSS removed
  - `site/layouts/partials/service-paint.html` — final-cta HTML + CSS removed
- ⛔ **DATA ACCESS PATTERN LOCKED (owner order, 2026-07-22):** All templates MUST use `site.Data.business` and `site.Data.services` (NOT `hugo.Data.*`). The `hugo.Data` module is not available locally and causes build failures. Files locked to this pattern:
  - `site/layouts/_default/baseof.html`
  - `site/layouts/_default/single.html`
  - `site/layouts/partials/seo.html`
  - `site/layouts/partials/footer-desktop.html`
  - `site/layouts/partials/footer-mobile.html`
  - `site/layouts/partials/other-services.html`
  - All 4 page templates (tentang-kami, hubungi-kami, blog, servis)
- ⛔ **MASTER ROLLBACK SNAPSHOT (2026-07-22):** This tag is the canonical known-good state of the entire website:
  ```bash
  git tag lock-master-20260722 bd5ab75
  # To roll back entire site to this state:
  git reset --hard lock-master-20260722
  git push origin master --force
  # Then redeploy Worker:
  cd cf-api && npx wrangler deploy
  ```
- Frontend: www.jayabina.com (Hugo build from `site/`). Booking funnel PRIMARY di `www.jayabina.com/servis-cuci-tangki-air/`: booking → Bayarcash deposit RM150 → `www.jayabina.com/success.html`. Worker var `SITE_URL=https://www.jayabina.com`. The old cuci.jayabina.com Pages project (`jayabina`) has been decommissioned — all content migrated to www.
- Portals: staff → `staff.jayabina.com` (Worker `jayabina-staff-router`, `cf-staff-router/`, serves `/worker/` from www); pelanggan → `akaun.jayabina.com` (Worker `jayabina-akaun-router`, `cf-akaun-router/`, serves `/customer/` from www).
- CI: `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare-pages.yml` deploys TWO projects on push to master: `jayabina` (www, Hugo build from `site/`, `--branch main`) and `jayabina-admin` (admin panel, `--branch master`).
- API: Cloudflare Worker `jayabina-api` (`cf-api/`). **Canonical public URL: `https://api.jayabina.com`** (Worker custom domain, added 2026-07-18). The legacy `https://jayabina-api.banktifweb.workers.dev` hostname still works but must not be referenced in frontend code. Do NOT redeploy the Worker under a new name — secrets (Bayarcash, backup, GH_PAT) cannot be copied and payments would break.
- Database/Auth: Cloudflare D1 `jayabina-db` plus custom PBKDF2/JWT auth. Supabase is legacy source data only and is no longer called by the production frontend.
- Frontend client: `/jc-api.js`; served apps are `admin/index.html`, `worker/index.html`, and `customer/index.html`.
- Backup: native R2 binding `BACKUP_R2` to bucket `jayabina-backups`; password hashes and `private_settings` are excluded from archive payloads.
- Secrets: use `wrangler secret put`. Never add empty secret placeholders to `wrangler.jsonc`, because a deploy can overwrite a real secret binding.
- Worker deploy: `cd cf-api && wrangler deploy`.
- Frontend deploy: run `build.sh` where Hugo is installed, then `wrangler pages deploy public --project-name jayabina --branch main`.
- D1 sync must be idempotent. Do not truncate D1 during future legacy-data imports.
- Supabase Auth password hashes are not portable. Reset migrated staff passwords from Admin > Staff; never restore first-login password claiming.

## 0. MANDATORY PRE-WORK — read these before any change
1. `AGENTS.md` (this file) — rules, schema, locked decisions
2. `BUILD-PLAN.md` — phased build runbook + current progress
3. `PROJECT-MEMORY.md` — quick status + credentials location
4. `cuci-tangki/SALES-PAGE-COPY.md` — complete sales page copywriting reference (all headlines, body copy, FAQ, image placeholders)

## 1. WHAT THIS IS
JAYABINA — a water-tank cleaning service business (company: **Jaya Bina Services**).
- Public sales page + online booking + Bayarcash deposit payment
- Admin dashboard to manage bookings
- (Building) Staff task manager: 50 staff accounts, task assignment, before/after photos, schedule/calendar, WhatsApp notifications

Owner: Abdul Latif / banktifweb@gmail.com

|-------|------|
| Hosting | Cloudflare Pages (build + CDN) + Cloudflare DNS |
| Backend | Supabase (PostgreSQL + PostgREST + Auth + Edge Functions) |
| Images | Cloudinary (cloud_name `dkibczut`) |
| Payment | Bayarcash v3 (via Supabase Edge Function proxy) |
| Frontend | Static HTML + inline JS + `@supabase/supabase-js@2` (CDN). NO framework, NO build step. |
| Editor | GrapesJS (sales page editor) |

## 3. LOCKED DECISIONS (do not change without explicit owner approval)
- **Brand name:** JAYABINA. Company name **Jaya Bina Services** stays. Domain `www.jayabina.com` stays. Logo initials `JB`.
- **Language:** All admin/staff system UI + docs + code = **English**. WhatsApp message templates = **Bahasa Melayu**. Customer-facing pages (`index.html`, `success.html`, `test-pay.html`) stay **Bahasa Melayu**.
- **WhatsApp:** Semi-auto `wa.me` (free). No paid gateway. Messages pre-filled, sent with one tap.
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth. Admin + 50 staff have real accounts. Staff login via phone → synthetic email (`<digits>@staff.jayabina.local`) + password set by admin.
- **Photo storage:** Cloudinary unsigned upload preset. Folder `jayabina/tasks`.
- **Auto-assign:** Toggle in Settings > Automation. Can be On (auto) or Off (manual). Default: Off.
- **Config:** Non-secret config in `app_settings` table (Settings UI). Secrets in Supabase Edge secrets. Staff credentials in Supabase Auth (never plaintext).
- **Payment amount:** Always computed server-side from DB (`bookings.deposit_amount`), never trusted from client.
- **Pricing:** Total RM300, deposit RM150, balance RM150 (configurable via `app_settings`).
- **Theme:** Forest-green (accent `#166534`). `theme.css` is the single source of truth (tokens incl. `--menu-bg`/`--menu-overlay`). Favicon `/favicon.svg` = single letter **J**.
- **URL structure:** Clean URLs. Apps in folders (`admin/`, `worker/`, `customer/`), served from repo root. Editing the wrong file = broken app.
- **GrapesJS editor:** Multi-site (add any repo) for editing SALES PAGES, but has a **safety GUARD** (`protectReason()` in `editor.html`) that blocks app/system files: any path with `admin/worker/customer/dashboard/login/staff/app/api`, files `*.html` named admin/worker/customer/login/staff/dashboard, `sw.js`, `theme.css`, `manifest.json`, non-`.html` files, and (in the repo) anything except `index.html`. Guard runs on BOTH load and save. This lets the owner edit many sales-page repos without ever destroying the JAYABINA app.
- **DB backup destinations:** Google Drive + Cloudflare R2 ONLY. **Do NOT use Supabase Storage** (protect the 1 GB free quota). Retention keep-48 + auto-delete on both.
- **PWA:** `sw.js` MUST stay network-first (never cache-first) so updates show. Cloudflare cache rule bypasses `/sw.js`, `/theme.css`, HTML.

## 4. SECRETS — where they live (NEVER hardcode / commit)
| Secret | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Bayarcash PAT | Supabase secret `BAYARCASH_PAT` |
| Bayarcash API secret | Supabase secret `BAYARCASH_API_SECRET` |
| Bayarcash portal key | Supabase secret `BAYARCASH_PORTAL_KEY` |
| Payment channel | Supabase secret `BAYARCASH_PAYMENT_CHANNEL` (5 = DuitNow) |
| Site URL | Supabase secret `SITE_URL` |
| Supabase service role | Auto-injected into Edge Functions (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) |
| Supabase anon/publishable key | `sb_publishable_jFrl83f8l_tcWTulTL5lkQ_bLnCVpYR` (public, OK in client) |

⚠️ Known leak to fix: `cloudinary-onboard.js` contains Cloudinary `api_secret` in git — rotate it and never use api_secret in the browser. Browser uploads use an **unsigned preset** only.

---

## 5. DATABASE SCHEMA

### Existing
- `bookings` — id(uuid), customer_name, customer_phone, customer_address, booking_date, booking_time('9am'|'11am'|'2pm'|'4pm'), amount, deposit_amount, payment_status('pending'|'paid'|'failed'|'refunded'), bayarcash_ref, bayarcash_transaction_id, status('pending_payment'|'confirmed'|'completed'|'cancelled'), notes, created_at, updated_at
- `slots` — id, date, time_slot, is_booked, booking_id (UNIQUE(date,time_slot))
- RPC: `get_available_slots`, `check_slot`, `create_booking`

### New (Task Manager)
- `profiles` — id(=auth.uid), full_name, phone, role('admin'|'staff'), is_active(bool), created_at
- `tasks` — id(uuid), booking_id(FK), assigned_to(FK profiles), status('unassigned'|'assigned'|'in_progress'|'awaiting_review'|'completed'|'cancelled'), started_at, finished_at, completed_at, created_at, updated_at
- `task_photos` — id(uuid), task_id(FK), type('before'|'after'), url(text), uploaded_by(FK profiles), created_at
- `app_settings` — key(PK text), value(text), updated_at

### Trigger
- On `bookings` UPDATE when `status` becomes `confirmed` → insert one `tasks` row (status `unassigned`) if none exists for that booking.

---

## 6. RLS RULES (source of truth)
- `bookings`: anon **INSERT** allowed (public form); anon **SELECT** allowed (success.html polls by id); anon **UPDATE = REMOVED** (was insecure). Authenticated admin = full. Staff = SELECT only bookings linked to their assigned tasks.
- `slots`: anon INSERT + SELECT (booking flow). Admin full.
- `profiles`: user SELECT own; admin SELECT/UPDATE all. INSERT only via service role (staff-admin function).
- `tasks`: admin full; staff SELECT + UPDATE (status/timestamps) own assigned tasks only.
- `task_photos`: staff INSERT for own tasks + SELECT own; admin SELECT all.
- `app_settings`: admin SELECT/UPDATE; staff SELECT (read templates/config if needed).
- Role check via `profiles.role`. Edge Functions that need elevated writes use service role.

---

## 7. APP_SETTINGS KEYS (config-driven, editable in Settings UI)
| Key | Meaning |

## 8. FILE MAP
| File | Purpose | Language |
|------|---------|----------|
| `theme.css` | Shared design tokens (light/dark) + Lucide icon defaults + polish. Used by admin/staff/login ONLY (not customer pages). Single source of truth for colors. | - |
| `index.html` | Public sales page + booking + Bayarcash | Malay |
| `success.html` | Payment status page | Malay |
| `test-pay.html` | RM2 test payment page | Malay |
| `admin.html` | Admin dashboard (auth, bookings, tasks, schedule, staff, settings) | English |
| `login.html` | Unified Supabase Auth login → role redirect | English |
| `staff.html` | Staff dashboard (schedule, photos) | English |
| `editor.html` | GrapesJS sales page editor | Malay |
| `manifest.json` | PWA manifest | — |
| `supabase/functions/bayarcash/` | Payment intent + callback proxy | — |
| `supabase/functions/staff-admin/` | Admin-only staff account management | — |
| `supabase/migrations/*.sql` | DB schema + RLS | — |
| `build.sh` | Cloudflare Pages build script (Hugo + static copy) | — |
| `blog/config.toml` | Hugo configuration | — |
| `blog/content/blog/` | Blog articles (Markdown) | Malay |

| `blog/static/blog/admin/` | Decap CMS editor (blog admin) | — |

---

## 9. CONVENTIONS
- JS: `camelCase` functions/vars, plain ES5-ish inline (match existing style). No build tooling.
- SQL: snake_case. Tables created via migrations in `supabase/migrations/`. Always `NOTIFY pgrst,'reload schema'` after DDL affecting API.
- Edge Functions: Deno + TypeScript. CORS headers on browser-facing routes. Verify caller role for admin actions.
- Design: green theme, pill/rounded buttons, mobile-first. Admin/staff/login use Plus Jakarta Sans + `theme.css` (shared tokens) + **Lucide icons** (`<i data-lucide="name">`, auto-rendered via MutationObserver + `relucide()`). Customer pages use Poppins with their own inline styles.
- API responses from Edge Functions: `{"status":"ok","data":...}` or `{"error":"message"}`. Never leak raw exceptions.

---

## 10. DEPLOY
- Frontend: `git push origin master` → Cloudflare Pages auto-builds (`bash build.sh` → Hugo + static copy → deploy).
- Edge Function: `supabase functions deploy <name> --project-ref thbscwlcyhcnqsppoyfn` (needs `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` env).
- Secrets: `supabase secrets set KEY="..." --project-ref thbscwlcyhcnqsppoyfn`.
- Migrations: `supabase db push` (needs DB password) OR run SQL in Supabase dashboard SQL editor.

---

## 11. NEVER DO
- ❌ Hardcode/commit secrets (Bayarcash PAT, Cloudinary api_secret, service role key)
- ❌ Trust payment amount from client — always read from DB
- ❌ Store staff passwords as plaintext — use Supabase Auth
- ❌ Re-enable anon UPDATE on `bookings`
- ❌ Change locked decisions (section 3) without owner approval
- ❌ Put English in WhatsApp templates, or change customer pages to English

---

## 12. ACCOUNTS
- Admin (first): `banktifweb1@gmail.com` (Supabase Auth, role=admin)
- Legacy client-side password has been removed; credentials must never be stored in source control.

---

## 13. CURRENT ARCHITECTURE (2026-07-14) — authoritative

### Hosting
**Cloudflare Pages** (migrated from GitHub Pages). Build command: `bash build.sh`. Output: `public/`.
Repo source: `banktif/jayabina-salespage` (branch `master`).
Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys on every push to master.

### URL / file structure (clean URLs)
Cloudflare Pages serves the `public/` output directory. Real apps in folders; edit THESE:
| URL | Real file | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| `/` | `index.html` | Sales page (Malay). GrapesJS-editable. |
| `/admin/` | `admin/index.html` | Admin SPA. Inline Supabase Auth login. Hash routes (`#home,#bookings,#schedule,#staff,#reports,#settings,#backup`). |
| `/worker/` | `worker/index.html` | Staff portal (renamed from "staff"). |
| `/customer/` | `customer/index.html` | Customer self-service. |
| `/blog/` | Hugo-generated | Blog homepage (article listing + pagination). |
| `/blog/artikel-slug/` | Hugo-generated | Individual blog article. |
| `/blog/kategori/xxx/` | Hugo-generated | Category archive pages. |
| `/blog/tag/xxx/` | Hugo-generated | Tag archive pages. |
| `/blog/admin/` | Decap CMS | Blog editor (owner-only, GitHub OAuth). |
| `/editor` | `editor.html` | LOCKED to sales page only. |
| shared | `theme.css`, `favicon.svg`, `sw.js`, `manifest.json` | |
Root `admin.html`, `staff.html`, `login.html` = redirect stubs. `login/` removed.
⚠️ Always edit `admin/index.html` (NOT root `admin.html`).

### New tables (beyond section 5)
- `private_settings` — key/value, **RLS admin-only** (`is_admin()`), for secrets: `gdrive_client_email/private_key/folder_id`, `r2_account_id/access_key/secret_key/bucket`. Staff CANNOT read.
- `profiles` extra columns: `email`, `address`, `avatar_url`.

### Edge Functions (all in `supabase/functions/`, config in `supabase/config.toml`, verify_jwt=false + custom auth)
- `bayarcash` — payment intent + callback (checksum).
- `staff-admin` — admin-only: create/bulk/update/set_active/reset_password staff.
- `backup` — DB export → gzip → Google Drive + Cloudflare R2 (SigV4). Actions: `db` (force optional), `list`, `status`, `code` (trigger GitHub Actions), `test_r2`. Per-destination frequency + retention 48. Auth: admin JWT OR header `x-backup-key: BACKUP_SECRET` (for pg_cron).
- `wa-messenger` — WhatsApp messaging (added by owner).

### Backup system
- **Code → GitLab:** `.github/workflows/mirror-to-gitlab.yml`, cron `0 19 * * *` (daily 3AM MYT) + manual dispatch. Mirrors ALL owned repos (private) via `push --mirror`. Repo secrets: `GH_PAT`, `GL_TOKEN`, `GL_USER`.
- **DB → Google Drive + Cloudflare R2:** hourly pg_cron `jayabina-db-backup` calls `backup` fn with `x-backup-key`; fn honors `backup_freq_drive` / `backup_freq_r2` (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly). Config entered in admin Backup page → `private_settings`.
- Admin Backup page = `showBackup()` in `admin/index.html` (nav `dsBackup`, hash `#backup`). If it disappears, a GrapesJS/overwrite happened — re-add from PROJECT-MEMORY/BUILD-PLAN.

### app_settings — backup keys
`backup_freq_drive`, `backup_freq_r2`, `backup_last_drive_at/status`, `backup_last_r2_at/status`, `backup_last_code_at/status`, `backup_last_db_at/status`.

### Secrets — additions to section 4
| Secret | Location |
|--------|----------|
| `BACKUP_SECRET` | Supabase secret (pg_cron auth) |
| `GH_PAT` | Supabase secret (trigger workflow) + GitHub repo secret (mirror) |
| `GL_TOKEN`, `GL_USER` | GitHub repo secrets |
| Google Drive SA + R2 creds | DB `private_settings` (admin-only) |
| Cloudflare | zone `916289c458db6233106080096fe910ed`; cache-bypass rule set for sw.js/theme.css/HTML |

### PWA / cache
`sw.js` network-first, cache `jayabina-v1`. Cloudflare cache rule bypasses `/sw.js`, `/theme.css`, HTML. To force update: purge Cloudflare + clear browser SW/site data once.

### Deploy note
Deploy Edge Functions + git ops from repo root (`Downloads/jayabina`). Management API for SQL:
`POST https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/thbscwlcyhcnqsppoyfn/database/query` with `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` (read SQL via `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllText` to avoid PS note-property JSON bug; keep SQL ASCII — no em-dashes).

---

## 14. HUGO BLOG SYSTEM (added 2026-07-14)

### Architecture
- **Generator:** Hugo (Go-based static site generator, installed in Cloudflare Pages build env).
- **Source:** `blog/` (config, content, layouts, static, assets).
- **Build:** Cloudflare Pages runs `build.sh` → `cd blog && hugo --minify --destination ../public` → copies static files + app folders.
- **Output:** Deployed from `public/` directory to Cloudflare Pages global CDN.
- **Design:** Customer-facing — Poppins font, green theme (`#166534`), responsive, mobile-first. Custom templates in `blog/layouts/`.
- **CMS:** Decap CMS (`/blog/admin/`) — owner login via GitHub OAuth → write articles in rich text editor → commit `.md` to repo → Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys.

### URL structure
| URL | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `/blog/` | Blog homepage (paginated article cards, 12/page) |
| `/blog/artikel-slug/` | Single article (title, content, share buttons, related posts) |
| `/blog/kategori/nama/` | Articles by category |
| `/blog/tag/nama/` | Articles by tag |
| `/blog/index.xml` | RSS feed |
| `/blog/admin/` | Decap CMS editor |

### Hugo config (`blog/config.toml`)
- `baseURL`: `https://www.jayabina.com/`
- `disableKinds: ["home"]` — prevents Hugo from generating root `/` (sales page handles root)
- Custom taxonomies: `kategori`, `tag` (Bahasa Melayu)
- Permalinks: categories at `/blog/kategori/:slug/`, tags at `/blog/tag/:slug/`
- Pagination: 12 articles per page

### Content structure
```
blog/content/
├── blog/
│   ├── _index.md              (blog section listing)
│   ├── 2026-07-12-slug.md     (article)
│   └── ...
├── kategori/
│   └── _index.md              (taxonomy list → /blog/kategori/)
└── tag/
    └── _index.md              (taxonomy list → /blog/tag/)
```

### AI autonomous publishing flow
1. DeepSeek AI generates articles with `date` field set progressively (5/day → 6/day → ...).
2. All articles committed to `blog/content/blog/` once.
3. Hugo only publishes articles where `date <= today` — future-dated articles are hidden.
4. Daily Cloudflare Pages cron build (or push trigger) → auto-publish next batch.
5. Zero touch for 3 months until all 5000 articles are live.

### Decap CMS (`blog/static/blog/admin/`)
- `config.yml`: Backend=GitHub, repo=banktif/jayabina-salespage, branch=master.
- Collections: "blog" → folder `blog/content/blog`, fields: title, date, kategori, tag, description, image, body.
- Media: Cloudinary (cloud_name `dkibczut`). Images uploaded via drag-drop in editor.

### Build flow (`build.sh`)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
rm -rf public; mkdir public
cd blog && hugo --minify --destination ../public && cd ..
cp index.html success.html test-pay.html favicon.svg sw.js manifest.json theme.css .nojekyll CNAME public/
cp -r admin worker customer public/
```

### Important: NEVER
- ❌ Edit files in `public/` directly (generated, overwritten on each build)
- ❌ Put images in `blog/static/img/` for 5000 articles (use Cloudinary URLs in markdown)
- ❌ Change `disableKinds: ["home"]` — will overwrite sales page `index.html`
- ❌ Move Hugo source outside `blog/` — Cloudflare Pages expects Hugo config there

---

## REPO-SPECIFIC NOTES

- **Stack:** Cloudflare Pages (Hugo frontend), Cloudflare Workers (`cf-api/`, custom PBKDF2/JWT auth), Cloudflare D1 (SQLite-at-edge), Bayarcash v3 payments, Cloudinary images, GrapesJS visual editor.
- **Silent breakage risks:** JWT token sign/verify shares `JWT_SECRET` between Worker deploy and D1 — if either secret drifts, all auth breaks. `wrangler deploy` with empty `wrangler.jsonc` bindings can overwrite secrets. CF Pages CI deploys from `site/` Hugo output, not repo root — always sync `worker/index.html` and `customer/index.html` to `site/static/`. Bayarcash callback URL must match production Worker domain exactly. D1 migrations must be idempotent — never `DROP TABLE` without explicit owner instruction.
